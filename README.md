# GenAI-InfoExtractor

GenAI-InfoExtractor is a comprehensive Generative AI-based Question Answering (QA) system designed to extract knowledge from CSV files and provide answers through an intuitive Streamlit interface. This project leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to build a robust and efficient knowledge base.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Creation**: Automatically creates a vector database from a CSV file containing FAQs or other information.
- **Advanced Embeddings**: Uses HuggingFace Instruct Embeddings for high-quality vector representations.
- **Efficient Similarity Search**: Implements FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for quick and accurate retrieval of relevant information.
- **Generative Answering**: Utilizes GooglePalm as the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) to generate contextually accurate answers.
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction and querying of the knowledge base.

## Project Overview

GenAI-InfoExtractor is designed to streamline the process of extracting and querying information from large datasets. By converting CSV data into a searchable vector database, users can easily find answers to their questions without manually sifting through the data. The project integrates several key technologies:

- **Langchain-Community Tools**: For embedding, vector storage, document loading, and LLM integration.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web application.
- **GooglePalm API**: For generating natural language answers.

The primary components of the project are:

1. **main.py**: The main script that runs the Streamlit application.
2. **helper.py**: Contains helper functions for creating the vector database and the QA chain.
3. **faqs.csv**: A sample CSV file with FAQs used to build the knowledge base.

## Dependencies

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.
- **Langchain-Community**: Tools for embedding, vector storage, and LLM integration.
- **GooglePalm API**: For generating answers using a large language model.
- **HuggingFace Instruct Embeddings**: For high-quality vector embeddings.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and loading.
